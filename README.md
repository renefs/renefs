Hi, I’m René. I have 15+ years of experience developing software where reliability is the priority. My career moved from building commercial web platforms to designing the global multimedia systems used at CERN ⚛️.

While my primary contributions occur within my professional role, I try to remain active in the community by exploring new technologies through side projects and contributing to open-source software.
